# USM-String-Hash-tool

This tool converts string to hash code by using a function created by Lemon Haze.

## Usage

## Compiling

This tool is comiled with mingw compiler on linux. I have no idea how to do it on windows.

Make sure you have installed `mingw-w64-i686-dev` (necessary for this compilation) or `mingw-w64` (to install the full toolchain).

Type the following commands to compile the tool.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Then find **hashtool.exe** in bin folder.

If you modify the manifest file, you will need to recreate the res.o file first.
```bash
i686-w64-mingw32-windres hashtool.rc -O coff -o hashtool.res.o
```
